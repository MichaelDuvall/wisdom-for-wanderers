This git repository is meant to accompany the [LocomotiveCMS Making a Blog tutorial](http://doc.locomotivecms.com/making-blog). Readers can follow along with the tutorial by cloning the respository and checking out the appropriate branch.

To clone the repository open a new command line and navigate to the directory where you would like to put the tutorial. Then run:

    $ git clone git@github.com:locomotivecms/wisdom-for-wanderers.git

After you've cloned the repository, change into the repo's directory. Then if, for example, you are reading Chapter 1.1 and you get stuck, run the following command to change to the appropriate branch.

    $ git checkout chapter-1.1

You can now view a copy of all files at this point in the tutorial to aid in any trouble shooting.
